It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
In this video course, we cover advanced malware analysis topics. Towards this goal, we first understand the behavior of different classes of malware. Such knowledge helps us to easily categorize malware based on its characteristic. We see how sophisticated malware can use techniques to either evade detection or increase its damage and access to the system. 
Then we learn advanced techniques in static and dynamic malware analysis and cover the details and powerful features of OllyDbg, IDA Pro, and WINDBG. We also explore defense mechanisms against malware, create a signature for malware, and set up an intrusion detection system (IDS) to prevent attacks.
Finally, we cover the concept of packers and unpackers, and explore how to unpack packed malware to analyze it.
